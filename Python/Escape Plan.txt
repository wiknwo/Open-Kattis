ESCAPE PLAN

Write a program that will figure out how many robots can escape a coming storm by running to and hiding in holes.

- You have identified the locations of several of these holes, but each of them is large enough to fit only one robot.

- Assume that each robot that can escape travels from its current position directly to a hole. All robots travel at a speed of 10 meters per second.

________INPUT________

- The input will have multiple scenarios, at most 10.

- Each scenario starts with an integer 0 < m <= 200 indicating the number of robots in the field, followed by m lines indicating the x and y coordinates of each robot.

- integer 0 < n <= 200 indicating the number of holes, followed by n lines indicating the x and y coordinates of each hole.

- All coordinates will be floating-point numbers, given in meters. 

- No two holes will be at the same location, and no two robots will be at the same location. 

- The end of input is signified by m = 0

________OUTPUT________

For each scenario

- print the scenario number
- print how many robots could escape in 5 seconds
- 10 seconds
- 20 seconds
- Follow the format demonstrated in the sample output below.
- Print a blank line after each scenario. 
- You may assume that the answers will not change if the threshold times (5, 10, or 20 seconds) are perturbed by up to 10âˆ’6 seconds.

________SOLUTION________

1. All robots move to the closest hole to them at a speed of 10 metres every second from their current position

2. After 5 seconds count how many robots have made it to a hole

3. After 10 seconds, count how many robots have made it to a hole

4. After 20 seconds, count how many robots have made it to a hole

Distance = Speed * Time
